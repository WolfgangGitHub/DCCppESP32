# ESP32 Command Station Feature/Bug Tracking list
This document tracks features and bug fixes that are planned.

## v1.3.0
The primary focus for this will be improving the LCC integration and solve the crash caused by the DCC signal generation code.

### Updates from v1.2.3

#### JMRI Interface

- [x] Replaced WiFiServer code with socket_listener from OpenMRNLite.

#### DCC System

- [x] fix signal generation so it doesn't crash up when spi_flash disables cache.
- [x] adjust motor board powerOn/powerOff to enable/disable DCC signal instead of using global power-on/off.
- [x] OPS RailCom support (not enableable yet).

#### LCC Integration

- [x] Integrate the WiFiConfiguration CDI element. Note, the Esp32WiFiManager code can be very noisy on the serial output and thus a PR will be submitted for adjusting log levels at runtime. In the meantime, this can be controlled via the CDI editor in JMRI by setting the uplink behavior to "manual only" to disable the Uplink/mDNS log messages.

#### Nextion Interface

- [x] fix screen type detection.
- [x] lock to title screen until WiFi connects.
- [x] switch to timer based speed increment/decrement on the nextion mcu side.

#### Web Interface

- [x] Add space in footer for clock so date/time are not smashed together.
- [x] Fixed S88 section hiding.
- [x] Fixed S88 sensor bus creation/edit json payload parameters.
- [x] Reintroduce websocket usage for pushing commands back to the CS (improves performance).
- [x] auto-refresh of status pages
- [x] add busy/wait spinner for when data is loading (or being refreshed) in the web interface.
- [x] Adding SPIFFSEditor for easy access to view/edit configuration data.

#### S88 Sensors

- [x] Add delay in s88SensorTask so that it gives time for other tasks to execute between updates.
- [x] restore custom web rendering of sensor data.

#### Configuration

- [x] rename of WIFI_SSID to SSID_NAME and WIFI_PASSWORD to SSID_PASSWORD to be in sync with upcoming changes.
- [x] Split up monolithic json files to instead be individual files.

#### General

- [x] Remove usage of log_X macros in favor of LOG.
- [x] Status LED output for WiFi, OPS and PROG.

## Future planning:
The entries below are not tracked to a specific release or in any particular priority order.

### General

### S88 Sensors

- [ ] Add S88 sensor data to InfoScreen status line, 16 sensor output rotation.

### DCC System

- [ ] continue sending eStop packet until eStop is cleared.
- [ ] implement BG task for prog track.
- [ ] remove hardware timer legacy code and refactor signal generation for RMT only.
- [ ] allow adjustment of the DCC preamble bit count, default is 16 (OPS) and 22 (PROG). The OPS value is constrained between 11 and 20 and PROG between 22 and 50.
- [ ] test and expose OPS RailCom configuration.

### Config

- [ ] move wifi config to NVS/SPIFFS.
- [ ] dynamic command station config via web
- [ ] SoftAP support for initial config and "non-home" network. (https://github.com/atanisoft/ESP32CommandStation/issues/4)

### Web Interface

- [ ] add dialog for failed CS requests.
- [ ] investigate tcp/ip hang (AsyncTCP LwIP crash? consider replacements for AsyncWebServer?)
- [ ] WiThrottle support (https://github.com/atanisoft/ESP32CommandStation/issues/15)
- [ ] Expose Loco Consist creation.
- [ ] Add strict validation of input parameter data.

### LCC Integration

- [ ] Traction proxy impl.
- [ ] Broadcast events for turnout state change.
- [ ] Discard turnout events when turnout already in expected state (drop duplicate events).
- [ ] adjust InfoScreen LCC details so they are actually useful, right now it is a placeholder.
- [ ] implement CV memory space.
- [ ] migrate to Esp32WiFiManager instead of Arduino WiFi library.

### Nextion Interface

- [ ] auto turn on of track power from Nextion when interacting with loco/turnouts.
- [ ] add notification of turnout state change when changed external to the nextion code.
- [ ] replace Routes page with a Setup page which will include route creation.
- [ ] implement automatic resolver for component id during page initialization so we can drop component IDs from the argument list.
- [ ] move screen detection code into NeoNextion lib.
- [ ] add support for Nextion Upload via OTA in NeoNextion.
- [ ] correct screen size detection for 5" and 7" displays which send the same screen type prefix.

### OTA

- [ ] OTA support via JMRI / LCC.
- [ ] return to normal mode on Nextion when OTA fails.

### InfoScreen

- [ ] Investigate multi-thread aware I2C library if/when available.
